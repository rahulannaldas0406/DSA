1. What is Time Complexity? (Easy Explanation)

Time complexity tells how fast an algorithm runs as the input size increases.

👉 We don’t measure in seconds because computers have different speed.
👉 We measure number of operations using Big-O notation.

⭐ Big-O Notation (Very Simple)
Big-O	Name	Meaning
O(1)	Constant time	Takes same time always
O(n)	Linear time	Grows directly with input size
O(log n)	Logarithmic time	Grows slowly even if input is big
O(n²)	Quadratic time	Very slow when input grows
O(2ⁿ)	Exponential	Extremely slow
O(n!)	Factorial time	Almost impossible for large inputs

'''O(1) = Best

O(log n) = Very fast

O(n) = Okay

O(n²) = Slow

O(2ⁿ), O(n!) = Very slow'''



2. What is Space Complexity?

Space complexity tells us how much extra memory an algorithm uses.

Two types:

Input space — memory needed for input (we ignore it usually)

Auxiliary space — extra memory algorithm uses (we care about this)
