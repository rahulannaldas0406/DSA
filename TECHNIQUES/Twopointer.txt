Two Pointers — Basic Problem
🔹 Problem: Pair with given sum

Given a sorted array and a number X, check if there exists a pair whose sum is X.

Example

arr = [1, 2, 4, 6, 8]
X = 10
Output: True   (because 4 + 6 = 10)

🧠 Hint (thinking):

One pointer at start, one at end

If sum is too small → move left pointer

If sum is too big → move right pointer

You shrink the search space every step

👉 This teaches directional thinking

Two pointer Technique:
-Uses Two Indicate to reduce nested loops
-works well on arrays & Strings
-often requires sorted data 

Types:
1.Opposite direction(left,right)
2.Same direction (Slow,fast)
3.Slow &Fast pointer


Benefits:
-Reduce 0(n^2) --> 0(n)
-Space efficient (0(1))

Used For:
-Pair sum 
-Reverse
-Remove Duplicates 
-Palindrome check


5 PRACTICE PROBLEMS (Beginner → Easy)

Solve these in order 👇

1️⃣ Check if array has pair with given sum (sorted)
2️⃣ Reverse a string
3️⃣ Remove duplicates from sorted array
4️⃣ Check palindrome string
5️⃣ Move all zeros to end
