Two Pointers — Basic Problem
🔹 Problem: Pair with given sum

Given a sorted array and a number X, check if there exists a pair whose sum is X.

Example

arr = [1, 2, 4, 6, 8]
X = 10
Output: True   (because 4 + 6 = 10)

🧠 Hint (thinking):

One pointer at start, one at end

If sum is too small → move left pointer

If sum is too big → move right pointer

You shrink the search space every step
