''' Write a program to check a given number is palindrome number or not'''

#i use for loop but it can't do because there is check so 
#to use if condition we can execute so 
'''n=12436
rev=0
while n>0:
    temp=n%10
    rev=rev*10+temp
    n=n//10
print(rev)'''
'''if n==rev:
    print("it is palindrome")
else:
    print("it is not palindrome")'''

'''Write a program to check a given number is armstrong number or not Ex:153 is an armstrong number'''

#it is also can't do using only one method so there is put cout while given number 

'''n=153
count=0

for i in str(n):
     count+=1
num=n
sum=0
for i in range(count):
     temp=num%10
     sum=sum+temp**count
     num=num//10
     
if sum==n:
     print("it is a amstrong")
else:
     print("it is not amstrong")'''

#I want to know parttens and perfect well know using loops
#NUMBERS PATTERNS

#Incremental numbers

'''for i in range(1,5):
    for j in range(1,i+1):
        print(j,end=" ")
